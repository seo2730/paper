A Study on the Management Method of Mission Planning Parameters Using Strategic Patterns

# Abstract
Mission plan has several parameters depending on the designer's mission definition. 
If these parameters are managed in a single code file, code must be written additionally when identifying additional parameters.
This simple addition of code makes it difficult to manage parameters as the length of the code increases and the readability of the code decreases.
For efficient parameter management, a strategy pattern is adopted in this paper. 
Strategy pattern is a pattern that creates a strategy class for each action that objects can perform and selects an algorithm during execution to change or operate the object in real-time. 
if object classes of multiple parameters are created and inherited based on one strategy class, the necessary parameters according to the mission plan are imported in real-time.
This management method is like fetching a function created by adding a single existing code, and it is managed efficiently because each parameter is classified into each class source code file. 
Therefore, in this paper, we propose a management method of mission planning parameters using a strategy pattern, one of the design patterns.
